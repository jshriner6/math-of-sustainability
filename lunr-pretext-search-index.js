  "title": "Units",
  "body": " Units   Units give measurements meaning. If units are ignored or mis-used, this could lead us to make (at best) inaccurate or (at worst) harmful conclusions. The purpose of this activity will be to practice working with and communicating measurements that contain units.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     convert a measurement from one unit to another.  communicate the meaning of a measurement by relating it to human experience.    Let's get to work...  Partner up with someone and assign the roles of Partner 1 and Partner 2 . Have a discussion using the script below, following the rule that the partner answering the question must give a numerical answer without units .  Partner 1: \"How far do you live from campus?\"  Partner 2: (Provide a numerical answer without units)  Partner 2: \"What's a normal temperature in your hometown right now?\"  Partner 1: (Provide a numerical answer without units)  Partner 1: \"How much weight would you be comfortable lifting over your head?\"  Partner 2: (Provide a numerical answer without units)  Partner 2: \"What's the longest distance you've ever run?\"  Partner 1: (Provide a numerical answer without units)    How much have you learned about your partner from their responses to these questions? Now use the script again, but provide units with your numerical answers.  Units give measurements meaning, so it is important that we have tools to work with and understand them.   A unit conversion factor is a ratio of numbers with units in which the numerator and denominator express the same quantity.   Take a moment to verbalize with your group why each of the following are examples of unit conversion factors, and any other observations or questions you have:   Unit conversion factors are used to convert a measurement in some unit to the same measurement in a different unit. For example, if I measured my height in inches to be inches but I wanted to know my height measured in the units of feet, I could compute Let's take a moment to notice a few important things about this calculation:  My goal was to convert from inches to feet. Therefore, I needed to use a conversion factor relating these two units:   When doing a computation with numbers and units, I can treat the number parts and unit parts separately. Gather all the numbers together with multiplication and division, and gather all the units together with multiplcation and division. Units can cancel just like numbers!  When converting from inches to feet, I have a choice between using or . Knowing that units can cancel each other out helps me pick the correct form of the converstion factor, . In general, you will always want to set up the conversion factor so that the unit you are converting from is in the denominator , and the unit you are converting to is in the numerator .  Why does multiplying by not change the value of my original measurement? Remember that , so multiplying a number by is the same as multiplying by , which does not change its value.      Unit Conversion Factors Part 1   Now let's practice choosing correct unit conversion factors. Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button.  Move the pieces to form the correct unit conversion factor that would be used to convert      Before moving on, get at least three correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to choose a correct unit conversion factor as if you were explaining it to someone new.      Unit Conversion Factors Part 2   Now let's practice a full computation. Replace number with a correct number and unit with a correct unit abbreviation. Enter your numbers without using commas. Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button.  Convert      Before moving on, get at least three correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to perform a unit conversion as if you were explaining it to someone new.      Back to work...  At times we encounter measurements that are so extreme that it can be difficult to process them in a meaningful way. In these cases, it is useful to be able to frame the measurements in a way that is more relatable to our human experience. In what follows, you will get practice using unit conversions to communicate extreme measurements in a meaningful way.  As an example, let's say you're told that that the weight of the garbage deposited in your state's landfills in a calendar year was million tons ( this was true of Colorado in 2016! ). How much trash is this, really? We could pick something for comparison that we believe is common to most people's experience, like a school bus. We can then attempt to convert the measurement of million tons to the more relatable unit of school buses . So we'd like to convert from units of tons to units of school buses .  While weights of school buses vary, taking an approximate weight of an average school bus will be sufficient towards making this weight more meaningful. We will use the average school bus weight as pounds. This gives us a unit conversion factor of . This doesn't give us a single unit conversion factor relating tons and school buses , but we can convert tons to pounds ( ), and then pounds to school buses . As a computation, it looks like this: , or equivalently school buses! That's a lot of trash!    Relatable Measurements   While there is never one correct way to make extreme measurements more meaningful, it is always helpful to frame them in a way that you think will be more relatable to someone's common experience! Let's practice that now.     Individually, convert the following measurements to more meaningful units:  billion pounds   trillion     $ billion   million miles         Spend time in your group sharing your work. Discuss your process for performing the unit conversions, and which conversions you think are the most relatable.     Curious about these measurements?     billion pounds is the annual food waste in the U.S.   trillion is the volume of Lake Superior.  $ billion is the net worth of one of the world's wealthiest individuals.   million miles is the distance from the Earth to the sun.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  Why are units in measurements important?  Your friend wants to convert their weight from pounds to a unit called stone . What information would you tell them they need in order to do so? How would you tell them to use that information to accurately convert their weight from pounds to stone?  What are properties of a measurement that make it meaningful to you?

  "title": "Change and Estimation",
  "body": " Change and Estimation   Measurements used in discussions of complex questions are often not exact, but estimates of some exact meansurement. The purpose of this activity will be to describe some common ways that measurements can be estimated so that you understand these estimates when they are presented to you, and can create your own estimates to communicate to others.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     approximate relative change using pure numbers and percentages.  write very large or very small numbers in a user-friendly way.  make order-of-magnitude estimates.    Let's get to work...  In questions of sustainability, we are often dealing with measurements that change over time. Therefore, it is important that we are able to describe this change. There are two main ways we could do this:  We could describe the absolute change . For example, if a population is currently individuals, and a year later grows to to individuals, we could say that the absolute change from one year to the next is individuals.  We could describe the relative change . In the same example, we could say that the population grew by , since is of the initial population of .    In this activity, we will focus on describing the relative change of measurements, since this generally is most informative. Following our example above, if you told someone that the population grew by individuals, it is not clear how significant this growth is. Is a lot? a little? That significance is clarified when we describe the relative growth as a percent of the initial population. The growth of individuals is very small compared to the initial population of .  We can describe relative change using percentages or pure number multiples. The following examples illustrate both of these methods:  A bank account increased from to . It grew by times, or by .  The mass of nitrogen in a soil sample decreased from g to g. It decreased by times, or by .    Let's make two general observations about these examples that we can use moving forward:  Describing change using pure number multiples requires setting up the ratio . The resulting number is unitless, and gives us the constant multiple of the old measurement that would result in the new measurement. A pure number multiple greater than signifies the measurement increased, while a pure number multiple between and signifies the measurement decreased.  Describing change using percentages can be obtained from a pure number multiple as for increasing measurments, or for decreasing measurements.       Back to work...  Suppose you were told that the annual emmissions from a given country was tons. Would your interpretation of that measurement be significantly different if you instead were told that the amount was tons? These two measurement have the same order-of-magnitude , which can be a useful concept to understand for interpreting and creating estimates of very large or very small measurements. Watch this brief video as a group for an introduction to orders of magnitude.    The power of used when writing numbers in scientific notation is called the order-of-magnitude of that number. This is often the most usable part of a measurment for practical purposes, and is also the best starting place for making estimates of measurements that have limited information. We call an estimate of the form an order-of-magnitude estimate .   Curious about the actual values?    For 2024-25, the student count was . The order of magnitude is .  The average mass is roughly kg. The order of magnitude is .  The distance is roughly m ( miles). The order of magnitude is .  There's no clear answer for this one. How might you go about using your experience to make the best order of magnitude estimate that you can?       Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are the different methods that you can use to describe how a measurement has changed over time? How are these methods similar? How are they different?  Why is it useful to use scientific notation to write very large or very small numbers?  What is the order-of-magnitude of a number?

The purpose of this activity is to introduce stock-flow models and system diagrams for representing such systems.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...   Section Objectives   represent a stock-flow model with a system diagram.    Let's get to work...  Imagine a bathtub filled with water. The faucet is running and the drain is open. You may look at this system and notice that either  the water level in the tub is staying the same,  the water level is increasing, or  the water level is decreasing.    Regardless of what you observe, this is a system in movement! While this is a simple system, it contains the important components we often need to consider in sustainability questions:  The amount of water is a quantity of the system that we care to measure.  The faucet and the drain are components that contribute to change in the amount of water.    These components are generally referred to as stocks and flows , respectively.   A stock is a quantity in a system that can be added to or taken from over time.  A flow is a process in a system that can add to or take away from a stock.   The identification of stocks and flows in a system is called a stock-flow model of that system.     Back to work...  Once we have a stock-flow model of a system, it is useful to be able to represent that model with a visual. The standard representation for these is called a system diagram .  Let's consider our bathtub example from the beginning of this section. A basic system diagram for this system might look as follows:    A system diagram for the bathtub example showing stocks as squares, flows as arrows, and flow rate processes as triangles.   Let's make some observations about this system diagram:  The stock (volume of water) is represented with a square. While there is only one stock in this system diagram, it is possible to have multiple stocks in a system diagram.  The flows are represented with arrows, indicating whether they are making the stock increase ( inflow ) or decrease ( outflow ). Each flow arrow into or out of the stock is associated with a triangle, which represents a mechanism or process which controls the rate of the corresponding flow.  The circles represent stocks outside of the system we are considering. If these stocks contribute inflows into our system they are called sources . If these stocks receive outflows from our system, they are called sinks .  So far our system diagram is a visual organization of the stocks and flows we've identified in our system. These stocks and flows can also be associated with measurements (that have units ), which we'll need in order to make computations and predictions about our system. This will become our focus in the next sections.      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are stocks and flows, and how are they related?  What things do you consider when creating a stock-flow model for a system?  Is there a single best stock-flow model for a system?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "

The purpose of this activity is to be able to recognize when stocks are in such a state.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     calculate the net flow of a stock and recognize when a stock is in equilibrium.  calculate the residence time associated with a stock in equilibrium.    Let's get to work...  Let's return to our system diagram for a bathtub system from .  Recall that the arrows represent flows of the system, and the triangles represent processes that control the rate of each flow. The system diagram helps us to understand the important components of a system and how they are related, but to understand the behavior of the system we must also know the measurements involved: the numerical values of the stocks and the rates, along with their units. Let's consider three examples.  The water volume is gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is , and the outflow rate to the drain is . In this scenario, the outflow rate is greater than the inflow rate, so over time the volume of water will decrease.  The water volume is gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is , and the outflow rate to the drain is . In this scenario, the inflow rate is greater than the outflow rate, so over time the volume of water will increase.  The water volume is gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is , and the outflow rate to the drain is . In this scenario, the inflow rate is equal to the inflow rate, so over time the volume of water will remain at gallons.    Let's make a few important observations about these examples.  In all of the examples we are comparing the inflow rates to the outflow rates to determine the qualitative behavior of the volume of water over time. To be more precise, we could calculate the net flow rate : If there were multiple flows in the same direction, we would add them to get the total flow in that direction. A positive net flow for a stock means that stock is increasing over time, while a negative net flow for a stock means that stock is decreasing over time. Calculate the net flows for each example above, then check your answers below. Include units in your answer. Check Answers Here         In the last example, the net flow is . If a stock's net flow is , we say that stock is in equilibrium . In this case, the equilibrium value of the stock is gallons.  Our focus in this chapter will be mostly on systems in equilibrium. In general this will be more complex than what we've just considered. For example, flow rates may not be constant. We will re-visit systems not in equilibrium and how they change over time in chapter 4.       Back to work...  A stock in equilibrium is not changing in quantity. But as we've discussed, it is moving . If the inflows and outflows for a stock are both non-zero, even when a stock may appear to be static, the constant quantity is never comprised of the same stuff . There is a measure for the average time a unit of stock will spend between inflow and outflow, which is what we will explore next.   The residence time associated with a stock in equilibrium is the number .     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What is the net flow rate of a stock, and why is it important in determining the behavior of a stock over time?  What does the residence time of a stock in equilibrium tell us about that stock?

  "title": "Equilibrium Values",
  "body": " Equilibrium Values   In real-world systems there are typically factors that influence the rates of flows within stock-flow models. The purpose of this activity is to consider a common influence, and its impact on the value of a stock in equilibrium.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     recognize dependencies between stock values and flow rates, and represent them on a system diagram.  compute equilibrium values in stock-flow models with a single stock.    Let's get to work...  Let's return once again to our system diagram for a bathtub system from , with one small addition:    A system diagram for the bathtub example showing stocks as squares, flows as arrows, flow rate processes as triangles, and the dependency between water volume and the drain rate as a red link.   In this new diagram we've added a red dependency link between the water stock and the outflow controlled by the drain. We've added this to indicate that the outflow is not, in fact, constant as we've assumed in previous examples, but it varies depending on the water depth value: a larger water depth value will result in a larger outflow rate through the drain.     Back to work...  As with our previous system diagrams, so far we've just identified and represented something in the system that will impact its behavior. To make dependency links useful in computation, we need to to know more specifically what that dependency is as an equation.  We now ask the same question as in : is this stock in equilibrium? With flow rates that change, the answer is not as straightforward as when they were constant. We will return to our example of the bathtub system from the beginning of the section.  For the sake of our example, let's assume that the inflow rate from the faucet is constant at gallons per minute, while the outflow rate (in gallons per minute) is dependent on the water depth (in inches) by the equation .  What are the units of the constant ?    We know that the stock will be in equilibrium when its inflow rate and outflow rate are equal. As an equation, that means that , or . We can solve for by dividing both sides of the equation by to get inches. This now gives us information to understand how our system will behave.  If our initial water volume is such that the depth is less than inches, then initially the inflow rate of gallons per minute will be greater than the outflow rate (why?). Therefore the net flow rate will be positive, and the water volume will increase until it reaches a depth of inches, at which point it will be in equilibrium.  If our initial water volume is such that the depth is greater than inches, then initially the inflow rate of gallons per minute will be less than the outflow rate (why?). Therefore the net flow rate will be negative, and the water volume will decrease until it reaches a depth of inches, at which point it will be in equilibrium.  If our initial water volume is such that the depth is equal to inches, then initially the inflow rate of gallons per minute will equal the outflow rate . Therefore the net flow will be zero, and the water volume will remain constant.      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are dependency links and why are they important in stock-flow models?  Why is it more challenging to compute the equilibrium value of a stock if the flow rates are not constant?  Do you think that stock values will always change towards an equilibrium value?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "

  "body": " Parameters   In real-world systems there may be factors which are not stocks within the system, but still influence the rates of flows within stock-flow models. The purpose of this activity is to consider these factors.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     recognize parameters in stock-flow models, and represent them on a system diagram.  analyze how parameter values affect equilibrium in stock-flow models.    Let's get to work...     Back to work...  One description of the system above could be a cup of coffee sitting on a table. Considered as a stock-flow model, we could say that the stock is the temperature of the coffee Technically you might say that our stock measures the amount of heat energy in the coffee, but since we can relate temperature directly to the heat energy, it is OK (and maybe more intuitive) to use temperature as a measurement in its place. (in degrees Celsius), and the only flow is the outflow of heat (measured in degrees Celsius per minute).  In this example, the outflow rate will be dependent not only on the value of the stock, but also on  the outside temperature that the cup of coffee is exposed to. It will cool faster if it's sitting outside in cold weather than if it's sitting inside on a counter at room temperature.  the insulation properties of the cup holding the coffee. It will stay warmer longer if it's in a glass container than it would if it's in a metal container.    From the perspective of the stock-flow model, these two factors do not fit into any component we've discussed so far. They are not stocks (quantities that are being added to or taken from) and they are not flows. We define these new components that we may want to account for in stock-flow models now.   A parameter in a stock-flow model is a quantity that affects one or more flow rate in the model, and is constant for a fixed model.   In the coffee cup example, the outside temperature and the insulation properties of the cup are both parameters. These values don't change for a fixed model (if the coffee cup is outside in a ceramic mug, these values are constants), but their values nevertheless will impact how the temperature behaves. In a system diagram, we will represent parameters with rectangles, and indicate the flow rate they impact with a dependency link. Here is an example of an updated system diagram for the coffee cup example.    A system diagram for the coffee cup example, including the insulation properties of the cup as well as the outside temperature as parameters which both affect the heat loss rate.      Back to work...  Working with parameters is important because it allows us to analyze multiple different models at once. For example, suppose we are interested in installing solar panels as an energy source for our home. We will use the stock-flow model represented by the system diagram below.    A system diagram for the amount of energy stored in solar panels, with an inflow from the sun, outflow from energy use, and a parameter of the panels' area which impacts the inflow rate from the sun.   The coverage area of the solar panels is a parameter because it is a constant once we install them, but it impacts the inflow rate of energy that we receive from the sun. We would like to determine the value of this parameter that results in an equilibrium value of for our stock.  Suppose that the outflow rate of energy from the panels is constant at watts. The inflow rate ( ) from the sun is dependent on both the amount of energy in the panels ( ), measured in watt-hours (Wh), and the area of the panels ( ), measured in square meters, according to the equation .  We also know that the stock is in equilibrium when the inflow rate is equal to the outflow rate, or as an equation, when .  Unlike in the last section, our equation has two unknown quantities, and . But we also know that we'd like the equilibrium value to be . Substituting this value into our equation gives , which can be solved to find that square meters. Using the parameter in our analysis helps us make an educated decision about the solar panels in order to achieve a certain behavior from the system.    Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  How are parameters different from stocks and flows?

  "title": "Networks and Graphs",
  "body": " Networks and Graphs   We live in a very connected world. From social interactions to predator-prey relationships, connections have a large impact on how systems behave. The purpose of this activity is to introduce an important mathematical tool used to model network connections.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     represent a network using a graph or directed graph.  determine basic properties of a graph.    Let's get to work...  A network is a set of entitities which have a rule that defines when two entities in the set are related. This is a very broad concept which arises in various contexts. For example, a network may consist of a set of twenty neighborhoods (call them A through T), with the rule that two neighborhoods are related if there is a road that connects them.   Mathematically, we can represent networks with graphs . Though you may have heard this term in a math class previously, it is likely different than what you are picturing. Below is an example of a graph of the neighborhood network we described above.    A graph whose vertices, labeled A through T, represent neiborhoods, and whose edges represent roads connecting neighborhoods.   Let's make some important observations about graphs using this example:  An entity (in this example, a neighborhood) is represented by a point called a vertex . Two entities are related (in this example, there is a road connecting two neighborhoods) if they are connected by a line called an edge . If two vertices are connected by an edge, we call them neighbors .  It is important to note that this graph communicates nothing about the actual physical location of each neighborhood. You can move the vertices anywhere you wish (try it!), and it would still be the same graph. The graph communicates only which entities are in the network, and how they are related to each other.    The number of edges coming from one vertex is called the degree of that vertex. For example, the degree of vertex A is , and the degree of vertex S is .  A path between two verices is a sequence of edges that connects one vertex to the other. A graph is connected if there is a path between any two verices. Otherwise, it is disconnected . For example, the graph of above is disconnected because there is no path from vertex M to vertex A. However, the graph obtained by ommitting vertices K through O is connected, as is the graph consisting of only vertices K through O.  A graph can be useful for making qualitative observations about a network. For example, while there is no path from vertices K through O to other vertices, they are highly connected to each other. Also, vertices A, J, and T seem to be structurally important neighborhoods. There are many roads connecting them to other neighborhoods (they have a high degree), and if we got rid of them, many more neighborhoods would become disconnected. We'll make these ideas more precise in the next section.      Back to work...  There are variations of graphs that can be obtained by adding additional structure based on the needs of your model. We present one such variation here due to its connection with our topic from .   A directed graph is a graph whose edges have a specified direction. That is, there are two different edges that could connect vertices A and B: the edge AB ( A to B ) and the edge BA ( B to A ).   The visual difference in directed graphs is that the edges are represented by arrows, which provide the additional information of direction. For example, directed graphs can be used to represent predator-prey relationships within an ecosystem. Take a moment to interpret the directed graph below in your group.    A directed graph showing the predator-prey relationships within an ecosystem.   Another example of directed graphs are the system diagrams that we've been using to visualize stock-flow models. The vertices of such a graph are the stocks, rate-controlling processes, sources\/sinks, and parameters in the model, while the directed edges are the inflow\/outflow arrows and the dependency links. Here is an example from :    On the left, the stock-flow model for the energy in solar panels is represented by a system diagram. On the right, the model is represented as a directed graph.   Note that the system diagram provides additional context about the model that, in many cases, can be useful.

  "title": "Resilience",
  "body": " Resilience   It is important to acknowledge that our systems are susceptible to changes that we may not be able to predict. Operating systems fail, natural disasters occur, and relationships end. Therefore, an important consideration in questions of sustainability is that of resilience: to what extent is a system able to continue functioning after sudden or unexpected damage? The purpose of this activity is to introduce two properties that we can compute to quantify the resilience of a network modeled as a graph.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     compute the density of a graph.  compute the clustering coefficient of a vertex.  compute the vertex and edge connectivity of a graph.    Let's get to work...   Resilience can reference various things in science and daily life. In this section, we use the term resilience as a measure of how connected a network is: to what extent can a network continue to function as intended in the midst of network connection failures? A specific class of graphs, which we define now, will be important in our discussion.   A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.   From the perspective of connectivity, complete graphs are as connected as a graph can be. Below are examples of complete graphs on , , and vertices, respectively.    Complete graphs with , , and vertices.     Back to work...  An intuitive way to describe how connected a network is would be to measure how closely the graph that represents it resembles a complete graph. One such measurement is called the density of the graph.   The density of a graph is the ratio .   The density of a graph will be a number between and , which can be thought of as the percentage of possible edges that the graph contains. Since we previously found a formula for the number of edges the complete graph with vertices contains, the density of a graph with vertices can be re-written as .    Back to work...  While a graph's density does give us some useful measure of how connected a graph is, we must be careful to understand what this number does (and does not) tell us, and that we can rarely draw conclusions from this number alone.  For example, suppose graph from above represents a signal network. The vertices are routers, and there is an edge between two vertices if those two routers can share a signal. From our density computation of , it might be tempting to say that this network is very connected . But from the perspective of resilience, how accurate is this statement? Most routers in the system could go down without impacting the ability of the other routers to communicate with one another. However, there is one router (can you identify which one?) whose failure would result in other routers being disconnected from one another. This is not ideal for resilient networks.  The important thing to note here is that a graph's density is a global measurement. That is, it is a number that says something about the graph's edges as a whole, but does not say anything about how they are distributed throughout the graph (which ultimately will determine the resilience of a network in situations such as the previous paragraph). In order to describe how edges are distributed throughout a graph, we need a local measurement. That is, a number that describes a graph's edges near a specific vertex.   The clustering coefficient of a vertex is the ratio . If the degree of is one or zero, is defined to be .   The clustering coefficient of a vertex will be a number between and , which can be thought of as the percentage of possible edges that the neighbors of contains. Assuming the vertex has degree , and using the formula for the number of edges the complete g raph with vertices contains, the clustering coefficient of can be re-written as .    Back to work...  The concept of a router failing and disconnecting other routers in the signal network example has a formal definition in the context of graphs.   The vertex connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of vertices whose removal (along with their associated edges) would disconnect the graph.   The vertex connectivity of graph from our previous examples is , because there is a single vertex that can be removed which disconnects the graph. There is also an analagous definition for the removal of edges.   The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges whose removal would disconnect the graph.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  Describe the different ways that we can measure the extent to which a graph is connected.  In what sense does measuring the connectivity of a graph tell us about the resilience of a network?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "

  "title": "Dynamic Models and Feedback",
  "body": " Dynamic Models and Feedback   Real-world stocks are dynamic. They are constantly moving based on many factors within the system that contains it. Sometimes that movement is less obvious than others, like when a stock is in equilibrium (i.e., the stock value is constant). However, important sustainability questions arise when stock values change over time. The purpose of this activity is to practice analyzing stock-flow models to determine common qualitative behaviors of stock values that are changing.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     identify and label feedback loops in system diagrams.  describe the general qualitative behavior of systems that can result from feedback loops.    Let's get to work...  We saw in that flow rates in and out of a stock will often vary depending on the stock's value. This is a critical factor which causes stock values to change over time, so we give it a special name.   In a stock-flow model, a feedback loop is a process in which a stock's value changes the behavior of a flow rate into or out of that stock.   Using terminology from , a feedback loop will exist whenever there is a dependency link between a stock and flow rate into or out of that stock. In this chapter, we will think more carefully about what that dependency link is, and how it impacts the behavior of the stock. Let's start with an example.  Suppose that our stock is the amount of phosphorus in a lake, and that our model has two flows:  An outflow of of phosphorus as water leaves the lake to a stream. This flow rate is proportional to the amount of phosphorus in the lake water (i.e., the more phosphorus in the water, the larger the outflow rate of phosphorus).  An inflow of phosphorus as plants and algae decompose. Since phosphorus is a nutrient for plants and algae, this flow rate also increases as the amount of phosphorus in the lake water increases.    How the amount of phosporus changes is dependent on how flow rates are impacted by the stock's value, which we described verbally. We can also represent this behavior in a system diagram:    A system diagram for the amount of phosphorus in a lake including feedback loops involving the inflow of phosphorus from plants and algae, and the outflow of phosphorus due to lake drainage.   Let's make some important observations about this new diagram.  We've added plus signs to the dependency links to indicate that an increase in the amount of phosphorus would increase both the inflow and outflow rates. In general, if an increase in the stock causes a flow rate to increase, we add a to that dependency link. If an increase in the stock causes a flow rate to decrease, we add a to that dependency link.   These dependency links form two different feedback loops which are different in nature.   The feedback loop between the plants\/algae rate and the phosphorus stock is called amplifying , because an increase in the phosphorus amount causes the inflow rate to increase, which further increases the amount of phosporus. In general, a feedback loop is amplifying if an increase in the stock value causes the flow rate to change in a way that further reinforces the increase of the stock's value.  The feedback loop between the lake drain rate and the phosphorus stock is called stabilizing , because an increase in the phosphorus amount causes the outflow rate to increase, which decreases the amount of phosporus. In general, a feedback loop is stabilizing if an increase in the stock value causes the flow rate to change in a way that counteracts the stock's value from further increasing.         Back to work...  In we saw the usefulness of communicating measurements with visual representations. When analyzing stock-flow models, it is often helpful to use graphs which display a stock's value over time. The type of graph that is used will depend on the nature of the dynamic model that we are using. There are two main types of models.   A continuous dynamical system is a system in which stock measurements are made continuously over a time interval. A discrete dynamical system is a system in which stock measurements are made at equally spaced time intervals (eg., a measurement is taken once every year).   The visual representation of a stock value over time in a continuous dynamical system is a line graph, while the visual representation of a stock value over time in a discrete dynamical system is a scatter plot. This distinction is illustrated for a system which measures a population over time in     On the left, the line graph of a population modeled as a continuous dynamical system. On the right, a scatter plot of a population modeled as a discrete dynamical system.   Unless stated otherwise, we will focus our analyses around continuous dynamical systems when sketching graphs of stock values over time. In this section, we will begin to develop a strategy for translating system diagrams for continuous systems to line graphs that describe the qualitative behavior of a stock over time (like whether the stock is increasing or decreasing). In the next sections, we will develop line graphs in more detail for some common types of models.  As a first example, let's consider a general system diagram of the following form:    A system diagram which contains one inflow and one outflow, both of which are part of amplifying feedback loops.   The diagram indicates that an increase in stock increases the inflow, and an increase in stock decreases the outflow. Both of these feedback loops are amplifying. How does a stock in such a system behave over time? There is not a single answer to this question, but we can begin to answer it by remembering what ultimately determines whether a stock value increases or decreases:   The amplifying feedback loops tell us how the flow rates change as the stock value changes. As stock increases, the inflow rate increases ( ), and the outflow rate decreases ( ). so we can combine this information to determine how the net flow rate changes as the stock value changes:   An increase in the first number in the difference and a decrease in the second number in the difference both cause the difference to increase. That is, as the stock value increases, the netflow increases. Here is an example of representing such a relationship with a line graph:    A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that as the stock value increases, so does the net flow rate.   Take careful note of the axis labels: Stock and Net Flow . This visual shows us that as stock values increase (as we move to the right on the horizontal axis), net flow values also increase (we move up on the vertical axis).  This graph will prove to be extremely valuable in determining the behavior of the stock with respect to time, and shows us that the behavior will be dependent on the stock's initial value. Let's consider a few cases.  If the stock's initial value is , then the graph shows us that the net flow will be negative. This meanse the stock will decrease. Since the net flow remains negative for stock values to the left of , the stock will continue to decrease as time moves on.   A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that if the stock value is one, the net flow will be negative, which means the stock will decrease from this initial stock value.    If the stock's initial value is , then the graph shows us that the net flow will be positive. This meanse the stock will increase. Since the net flow remains positive for stock values to the r ight of , the stock will continue to increase as time moves on.   A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that if the stock value is five, the net flow will be positive, which means the stock will increase from this initial stock value.    If the stock's initial value is , then the graph shows us that the net flow will be zero. This means the stock is in equilibrium, so it's value will not change. The stock will continue to have the equilibrium value as time moves on.   A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that if the stock value is three, the net flow will be zero, which means the stock will be in equilibrium.      Take a moment to use the interactive below to change the initial stock value on the horizontal axis, and see the resulting stock-time graph. Be sure to test the values mentioned in the cases above to verify the descriptions given.    On the left, a sample line graph showing the net flow rate increasing as stock value increases, with an equilibrium stock value of three. On the right, the corresponding line graph of the stock's value over time using the indicated initial value from the graph on the left.    While we analyzed just two specific models here, the general strategy developed is a useful one:  Determine how the net flow rate changes as the stock value changes, and represent this relationship as a line graph.  Use the line graph to describe how a stock's value will change for various initial values of the stock.  Translate your descriptions to a line graph of the stock over time.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  In a stock-flow model, what is a feedback loop, and why is it important in determining a stock's behavior over time?  What is the difference between a continuous dynamical system and a discrete dynamical system?  What are the similarities and differences in a stock's behavior over time in models with amplifying feedback loops versus stabilizing feedback loops?

  "title": "The Exponential Model",
  "body": " The Exponential Model   There is a particular dependency link relationship that occurs frequently in real-world systems. The purpose of this activity is to understand the behavior of stocks whose flow rates have this type of dependency.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     describe the characteristics of exponential behavior.  identify when feedback loops will result in exponential behavior of a stock over time, and sketch the general shape of that behavior.    Let's get to work...  A very common behavior exhibited of stocks in many systems (at least for a period of time) is exponential behavior . To understand this behavior, let's look at some examples of measurements over time that behave this way, and review calculating absolute change and relative change from .  Imagine that is a measurement of a population (in millions of individuals) after years.                               Let's look at one more example. Imagine that is a measurement of the amount nitrogen (in kilograms) left in a soil sample after years.                                Back to work...   An exponential relationship is a relationship whose relative change during any single unit of time is constant. If the constant relative change is greater than one, we call it exponential growth . If the the relative change is between zero and one, we call it exponential decay .   As we saw in the table calculuations above, exponential relationships can be good for describing models that either  Increase or decrease very rapidly, or  Increase or decrease very gradually.    A transformation of a line graph is a new line graph obtained from stretching, shifting, or reflecting the original line graph. Since transformations of exponential relationships still exhibit the general properties described above, we will also refer to transformations of exponentials relationships as exhibiting exponential behavior. It will be useful to be able to visualize the line graphs representing this behavior.    Back to work...  Now we will look at how exponential relationships arise in stock-flow models. Suppose we have a stock with a single inflow of units per second. If we assume an initial stock value of units, then after the first second we would have an inflow of units, meaning our total stock after the first second would be units. If we continue to take measurements after each second Note that we are treating this as a discrete system, in which measurements are taken at equally spaced time intervals. This is opposed to a continuous system, in which measurements are taken continuously over a time interval. , we would have the measurements recorded in after the first four seconds.                              This table should remind us of that we analyzed earlier: the stock's value is increasing rapidly, but if we compute the relative change between each time interval we get the constant . The inflow to this stock increases in an exponential way! This behavior is the result of the constant multiplication of the stock's value by the factor . Any flow rate of the form , where is a non-zero constant, will result in exponential behavior of the stock's value. If the flow rate has the form , where is a non-zero constant, this will result in a transformation of exponential behavior. Because of this, we give flow rates of this form a special name.   If a stock has a flow rate of the form , where and are constants, we say that flow rate is linear .   As we've just seen, linear flow rates in which the constant is non-zero result in exponential behavior of a stock's value. We saw in the previous section that it is the net flow rate of a stock that determines a stock's behavior over time, so the following fact is relevant.   If a stock's inflow and outflow rates are linear, then its net flow rate is also linear.   Let's return to our example of the stock with inflow rate , and suppose also there is a single outflow of units per second. Then the net flow rate for the stock is  . It is important to note that the negative sign in front of does not mean that the net flow is always negative! It depends on :  If , the net flow will be positive.  If , the net flow will be negative.  If , the net flow will be . That is, the stock is in equilibrium.    This is where it is helpful to have a line graph of the net flow rate with respect to the stock's value. In our example this would produce a graph that looks familiar from :   A line graph showing that the net flow decreases as the stock value increases.      Back to work...  We have now discussed some general characteristics of feedback loops, and also the specific case of exponential behavior.    Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are the characteristics of a stock that changes exponentially over time?  How do you know when feedback loops will result in exponential behavior of a stock?  How do you know when exponential behavior will be stabilizing or amplifying? What's the difference between these two types of behavior visually on a graph of the stock's value over time?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "

  "title": "The Logistic Model",
  "body": " The Logistic Model   In the last section we discussed linear flow rates, and the specific cases which result in exponential behavior of a stock over time. It is possible for flow rates to be non-linear, which in general result in more complicated stock behavior. The purpose of this activity is to introduce a common non-linear flow rate, and tools for analyzing the behavior of these models.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     describe the similarities and differences of the exponential and logistic models.  analyze the types of feedback present in a logistic model.  sketch a graph of a stock's value over time for a stock that follows a logistic model.    Let's get to work...  In the previous section we introduced exponential models, which arise when the net flow rate for a stock is linear (and not constant). There is a certain level of simplicity to these models because  There is always a single equilibrium value for the stock (when the linear net flow rate is equal to ), and  The overall feedback is always either amplifying or stabilizing (depending on whether the linear net flow rate increases or decreases as the the stock value increases).    These observations are illustrated in .    The graph on the left is for a stock that has a single equilibrium value of , and the overall feedback is always amplifying. The graph on the right is for a stock that has a single equilibrium value of , and the overall feedback is always stabilizing.   If we consider flow rates that are not linear, these observations are no longer true. In general, there could be multiple equilibrium values of the stock, and the overall feedback affect may depend on the stock's value. While this makes the model more complicated, these complexities may be desired in order to obtain a more accurate model.  Let's consider modeling a population that is increasing over time. A good first model would be to use an amplifying exponential model, such as . This does a nice job at capturing the tendency for reproduction (Net Flow) to increase with an increase in Population (P). Depending on the purpose of your model, however, there may be one large flaw. With a positive initial value, this is an amplifying exponential model which is increasing, and the line graph for the population over time would look something like .    The line graph of a population over time which grows exponentially.   While the pattern of increase may be accurate at first, this graph shows that the population will continue to increase more and more rapidly without end. It does not account for factors such as limited resources, which at some point should start to have a stabilizing affect on the population. The logistic model takes this into account.   A stock-flow model follows a logistic model if the net flow rate of the stock has the form . The constant represents the growth rate of the stock when the stock value is very small. The constant represents the carrying capacity (the maximum population that the environment can sustain).   Note that while the logistic model has an amplifying factor ( ), it also has a stabilizing factor . That is, as increases, also increases, but decreases. We'll analyze the overall affect of these competing factors now.  Suppose we have a stock-flow model of a population with a single inflow of , and no outflow. That is, the population's net flow rate is . The growth rate when the population is very small is , and the carrying capacity of this population is individuals. The net flow rate is non-linear, and the graph of the net flow rate with respect to the population (stock) value is given in .    The graph of the net flow rate of a population with respect to the population size. The net flow rate increases for population values less than fifty, and decreases for population values greater than fifty.     Back to work...  Our final goal will be to sketch a qualitatively accurate line graph of a stock's value over time whose behavior is directed by the logistic model.   We now have all the pieces needed to sketch a graph of a population over time which follows a logistic model. Let's start with the example from , whose net flow was given by .   Let's continue to practice modeling using the logistic model.   Note on Carrying Capacity  Do you wonder where the carrying capacity for a population comes from? It's possible to estimate this capacity with some initial measurements of a stock's value over time. If this is something you are interested in determining as part of a case study, please ask!    Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  How does the logistic model compare to the exponential model?  What are the equilibrium values in a logistic model?  What is the general behavior of a stock over time that follows the logistic model?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "

  "body": " Equilibria and Stabililty   We have discussed equilibrium values of a stock in various contexts, and have seen that they can be important values for a system whether or not that system is in equilibrium. The purpose of this activity is to determine how we can label an equilibrium value in a way that is descriptive of how the stock values behave around it.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     describe the stability of equilibrium values in a continuous dynamical system.  describe the stability of equilibrium values in a discrete dynamical system.    Let's get to work...  Imagine a system whose stock is currently in equilibrium. Then imagine some outside force nudging that stock value out of equilibrium. How will the stock behave now? The answer to this question is what we will generally refer to as the equilibrium value's stability . To start gaining an intutitve understanding of this concept, work through the following thought exercise in your group.   Your answers to the above questions are examples of the types of behavior we may see in real-world systems. While the behavior of real-world systems can be much more complicated than what we've described so far, our goal for this section will be to describe some common behaviors for the types of systems we've discussed in previous sections.  Recall from the distinction between  continuous dynamical systems, whose measurements are taken continuously over time, and are visually represented by line graphs, and  discrete dynamical systems, whose measurements are taken over equally spaced time intervals, and are visually represented by scatter plots.    When analyzing the behavior of systems nudged out of equilibrium, it is important for us to distinguish between these two types of models, as this can impact the types of behavior we can see.   Back to work...  First, we will explore stock behavior around equilibrium values in continuous dynamical systems.   An equilibrium value that behaves like that of Stock 1 is called a stable equilibrium value. An equilibrium value that behaves like that of Stock 2 is called an unstable equilibrium value.   The behavior around stable equilibrium values is reminiscent of the first system in , while the behavior around unstable equilibrium values is reminiscent of the second system in .     Back to work...  Now, we will explore stock behavior around equilibrium values in discrete dynamical systems. Recall that the only difference in this context is that stock measurements are taken at equally spaced intervals instead of continuously over time. There will be many similarities in the behavior that we saw in the continous case, but also some differences. Let's work through some examples to explore the discrete case in more detail.  In the discrete case, because measurements are taken on a set interval, we have to be a bit more specific than we were in the continuous case. It may not be sufficient to say that the stock is just increasing or decreasing. We may need to describe in more detail by how much the stock is increasing or decreasing. We can use the Net Flow rate information to help us do this.  For example, suppose the net flow rate for a stock is given by units per minute, and we are taking stock measurements every minute. If the current stock value is units, than units will be added to to get the new stock value after one minute. That is, if the current stock value is units, we can compute the next stock value after one minute with the computation     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What does the stability of an equilibrium value tell us about the behavior of a stock?  In what ways is the behavior around equilibrium values similar between discrete and continuous dynamical systems?  In what ways is the behavior around equilibrium values different between discrete and continuous dynamical systems?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "

  "body": " Tipping Points   We saw in the previous section that equilibrium values are central to a system's behavior over time. We also saw in that parameters can change what those equilibrium values are. The purpose of this activity is to look at the interaction of these concepts, and illustrate how small changes in a parameter of a system can result in abrupt, significant changes to a stock's behavior.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...   Section Objectives   approximate the sensitivity of an equilibrium value to a parameter value.  graphically recognize tipping points and analyze the behavior of systems around them.    Let's get to work...  Let's return to the example from , in which we are measuring the amount of phosphorus in a lake with an inflow from plant and algae decomposition and an outflow due to lake drain.   We will now add pollution from agricultural run-off as a parameter to our model, which impacts the inflow rate of phosphorus:    The system diagram for the amount of phosphorus in a lake with a parameter added for pollution from agricultural run-off.   The system diagram indicates that an increase in pollution will increase the inflow rate, and therefore increase the net flow rate for the stock. This is represented graphically below. Take a moment to play with the parameter slider and verify that for a fixed level of phosphorus, as pollution increases, the net flow increases as well.    The line graph for the net flow rate of phosphorus, along with a slider to change the parameter value of pollution. As polution increases, the net flow rate graph is shifted up.   Notice that as the pollution parameter changes, so do the equilibrium values. Measuring how parameters impact equilibrium values can be an important measurement for dynamical systems.   Let be an equilibrium value of a stock when a parameter has value . Suppose that if the parameter value is changed by a small amount If you're asking yourself what amount is considered small , that's a great question! This can be made more precise with tools f rom calculus, but for our purposes, we won't be too picky here. In general, the closer you can make the two parameter values, the more accurate your computation will be. to , the equilbrium value of the stock changes to . Then the sensitivity of to the parameter is the number .   For our next exercise, let's zoom in on on our net flow rate graph from above to focus on the phosphorus equilibrium value of when the pollution parameter is .    Back to work...  For the next exercise, use the graph and slider from .   The previous discussion illustrates that it is possible, in systems with parameters, that there are special parameter values that, if exceeded even by the smallest amount, can cause significant changes to the system. We give these parameter values a special name.   A parameter value in which any increase or decrease to the value causes a change in the number of equilibrium values of the stock is a called a tipping point value .   Our final exercise will help explore system behavior around tipping point values.    Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What does the sensitivity of a stock value to a parameter measure?  How is the sensitivity of a stock value to a parameter related to tipping point values of a parameter?  Why are tipping point values important?  What other systems do you think may contain tipping point values?     Section Checkpoint  Link here to Doenet course.   "
